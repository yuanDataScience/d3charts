# d3charts
establish a d3 chart library with resuable chart components. This library includes commonly used charts, which currently inculde bar chart, scatter plot, line chart where the x dimension is ordered, which is very good for visualizing time series line chart, and area chart.

This library applies the concept of "encapsulating reusabel charts" by Mike Bostock (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) and thus provide a uniform and easy to use interface funtions for users to configure the charts.

This library is still in progress. More configuration options will be added, such as chart legend, axis text orientations etc., and of course, will include more chart types.

Please visit https://gitcdn.xyz/cdn/yuanDataScience/d3charts/master/dist/index.html for a demo web page using D3chart as a library.

Thanks!
