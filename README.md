# d3charts
establish a d3 chart library with resuable chart components. This library includes commonly used charts, inculding bar chart, scatter plot, boxplot, line chart, area chart, donut/pie chart and force link chart.

This library applies the concept of "encapsulating reusabel charts" by Mike Bostock (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) and thus provide a uniform and easy to use interface funtions for users to configure the charts.
